- **Object Classification**
  - Multi-class classification of various objects (cars, airplanes, horses, etc.)
  - Uses CNN architecture for image recognition

## Decision Trees
- **Predicting Conversion in Digital Marketing**
  - Predicts customer conversion likelihood in digital marketing campaigns
  - Uses Decision Tree algorithm for classification
  - Features include customer behavior and campaign metrics
  - Helps optimize marketing strategies based on predicted conversion rates
 
## K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- **Library Recommendations System**
  - Recommends books for users using KNN algorithm
  - Works with real Arabic library data

## Linear Regression 
- **Student Performance Prediction**
  - Predicts student academic performance based on previous score, study hours,  and sleep hours
  - Implements Linear Regression for score prediction
  - Analyzes correlation between different variables and academic success
 
## Logistic Regression 
- **Arabic Fake News Detection**
  - Classifies Arabic news articles as real or fake
  - Uses Logistic Regression for binary classification
